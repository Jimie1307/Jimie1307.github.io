                    Welcome to my humble web portfolio! <br/>
                    I am a Web Developer, but also involved in Mobile Development as well. <br/>
                    How you may ask? <br/>
                    Well, that's the beauty of working in corporate sometimes, I guess.
                    In my case, I signed up for web development but ended up being involved in other stuff as well ðŸ™‚<br/>
                    You can view the technologies I have touched or currently learning under Career section!

                        I prefer hybrid work. Full remote work is a dream though!
